# Acme.VideoCatalog

## Introduction
Welcome to Acme.VideoCatalog, a WPF-based application designed to showcase advanced programming and architectural skills in a real-world context. This project simulates a video catalog system, retrieving movie data from a web service and displaying it in an intuitive user interface.

## Disclaimer
This project is a work in progress. It currently showcases the core functionality of a video catalog system, but additional features and refinements are planned. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.

## Description
Acme.VideoCatalog is built using WPF and .NET, leveraging C# for robust backend functionality. The application pulls JSON movie data from a web service and displays it in alphabetical order. A click on a movie title reveals more detailed information about the film, such as genre, release date, and rating.

Features:
- Alphabetical listing of movie titles.
- Detailed view for each movie.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

Why Over-Engineered:
- The project intentionally goes beyond basic requirements to demonstrate a deeper understanding of software design patterns and architectural principles. For example, the use of MVVM architecture, despite the simplicity of the application, showcases how scalable and maintainable code can be structured.
